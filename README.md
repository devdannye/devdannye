## Hello, World! 🌐

👨‍💻 My name is Danny, but I go by devdannye online.

🎓 I am a Software Engineering major at ASU.

⚙ My primary programming language is JavaScript (Node.JS) and hope to move towards utilizing TypeScript soon.

My goal this year is to build something new each week and work on that daily to build a nice portfolio of projects while expanding my comfort zone and knowledge as a programmer.
